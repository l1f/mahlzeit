# *Mahlzeit* -- manage recipes with your friends!

*Mahlzeit* (German word for *meal* or ) is a recipe manager that is intended for smaller communities.
The idea behind is: we all have common recipes that we love and that are kept somewhere.
Maybe it's written on paper, maybe it's bookmarked, but it's a mess. If you want to share a
recipe with someone, you either need to find the recipe again or send a photo of a printout.

It works, but it can be better. We've created *Mahlzeit* to have a central recipe management system
where we (read: our friends and maybe theirs) can write down recipes and build up a small collection of
tasty meals. All that without registering on a public third-party site, without dealing with comments from
strangers, etc.

**It's built by us for us.** And we aim to make it as accessible as possible.
